# FAQ

## What's KMP?

KMP (also written as MPP) is Kotlin Multiplatform - a certain approach to
Kotlin-language programming. This is suited to compilation into formats such
as JavaScript and Klib, as well as the typical JVM (Java-compatible) format
that most Kotlin projects use.

## What's KMM?

KMM is Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile. This is a software development kit (SDK) for
KMP which is designed for use in mobile development. While it has other
capabilities, our interest is primarily in the standard Android and iOS
integrations.

## What's React Native?

React Native is a toolkit for React. It comes with a bunch of Components, each
of which delegates off to platform-specific behavior. Put simply, it lets you
write React code that acts as an Android app on Android, and as an iOS app on
iOS.
